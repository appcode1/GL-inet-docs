# How to tether your phone to your router by using EasyTether.



There is several reasons you need to share your smartphone's data  to your router:

1. Carriers tries to give you a plan with plenty of data but actually you don't need that much.
2. 4G speed is quite fast and it beats your home Internet speed. You can use the data for your laptop.
3. Using your phone as a hotspot directly is easy, but you cannot connect too many devices.

It is very easy to share your data to GL.iNet mini router using router's control interfaces, but in some phone and carrier network, they limit sharing data directly, so you can try EasyTether.

We will use Android OS and GL mini router to demonstrate the procedure.

(For GL router, you can find the information on our website: www.gl-inet.com, and we will also indicate the position of the IPK driver file for our mini router in section iv.):
